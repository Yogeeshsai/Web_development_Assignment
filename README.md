Part 1: CMS Skills (WordPress/Shopify)
1. Custom Theme Development Experience
Yes, I have worked on custom theme development for both WordPress and Shopify.

WordPress:

I have created several custom themes from scratch for various clients, ensuring that the themes are responsive, SEO-friendly, and optimized for performance.
I use the WordPress theme development standards and follow best practices, including the use of template hierarchy, custom post types, custom fields, and the Customizer API for theme options.
I have also customized existing themes by creating child themes to add new functionalities and modify layouts without altering the parent theme's code.
Shopify:

I have developed custom themes using Shopify's Liquid templating language. This includes creating unique designs and functionalities tailored to the client’s needs.
I am familiar with Shopify’s theme structure, sections, snippets, and asset management.
I have also worked on customizing existing Shopify themes to enhance their functionality and appearance as per client requirements.
2. Frequently Used Plugins/Apps
WordPress Plugins:

Yoast SEO: For on-page SEO optimization, readability analysis, and XML sitemap generation.
Advanced Custom Fields (ACF): To add custom fields to posts, pages, and custom post types, providing a flexible content management experience.
WooCommerce: For e-commerce functionalities, including product management, payment gateways, and shipping options.
Contact Form 7: For creating and managing contact forms.
Elementor: A page builder plugin to create custom layouts and designs without coding.
Shopify Apps:

Shopify POS: To manage in-store sales and inventory alongside online sales.
Oberlo: For dropshipping and importing products directly to the store.
Klaviyo: For email marketing automation and segmentation.
Yotpo: For collecting and displaying customer reviews and ratings.
Bold Product Options: To add custom product options and variants beyond Shopify's default capabilities.
3. Developing or Customizing a Plugin/App
WordPress:
I developed a custom plugin for a client who needed a booking system integrated into their WordPress website. The process involved:

Defining the plugin structure and creating custom post types for bookings.
Adding metaboxes for additional booking information.
Creating shortcodes and widgets to display booking forms and calendars on the front end.
Integrating payment gateways using WooCommerce.
Outcome: The plugin provided a seamless booking experience for users and automated many of the client’s booking processes.

Shopify:
I customized the Shopify Store Locator app for a client to better fit their branding and to include additional functionalities like filtering by store amenities and integrating Google Maps API for enhanced location accuracy.

Outcome: The customized app improved user experience by providing a more intuitive and feature-rich store locator.

4. Setting Up a New Page or Post
WordPress:

Login to the Admin Dashboard.
Navigate to "Pages" or "Posts" in the sidebar.
Click "Add New."
Enter the title and content. You can use the block editor (Gutenberg) or the classic editor.
Set the featured image, categories, and tags (for posts).
Publish the page or post.
Shopify:

Login to the Admin Dashboard.
Navigate to "Products."
Click "Add Product."
Enter the product title, description, and upload images.
Set the price, inventory, and shipping details.
Add product variants if needed.
Save the product.
Differences:

In WordPress, setting up a page or post is focused on content creation with options for categorization and tags.
In Shopify, setting up a product involves detailed information about the product, such as pricing, inventory, and shipping.
5. Comfort with PHP and Liquid
PHP (WordPress): I am very comfortable with PHP and have extensive experience customizing themes and developing plugins. I am proficient in writing custom functions, hooks, and filters to extend WordPress functionalities.
Liquid (Shopify): I am also comfortable with Liquid for customizing Shopify themes. I have worked on creating custom templates, sections, and snippets, and I am familiar with using Liquid tags and filters to manipulate content and data.
